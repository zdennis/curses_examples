This repository contains examples for using Ruby's curses bindings. It is based the ncurses examples at https://github.com/zdennis/ncurses_examples.

The examples found in `programmers-guide-to-curses/` are based on the book Programmer's Guide to Curses by Dan Gookin. The book by Gookin was written targeted for C, and these examples are targeted for the Curses wrapper library in Ruby.

These are not to explain or introduce Curses or its ruby library. I am simply sharing my journey of learning about Curses with you by providing the examples free of charge. In my search for using Curses I have seen a lot of questions asked and not very many answers given. Perhaps these examples will help provide some clarification.

If they do provide help for you I'd love to know!
